# `03` Calling a Function  

A function could receive zero parameters, and it always returns something, even if you don't explicitly add the `return` statement.

üëâ [Click here to read more about functions](https://4geeks.com/lesson/working-with-functions-python).

For example: a function that calculates the area of a square will be something like this:

```python
def calculate_area(length, width):
    return length * width
```

If you want to use that function to calculate the area of a square with:

```python
length = 3
width = 6
```

You need to do something like this:

```python
area = calculate_area(3,6)
# The value of 'area' will be set to 18
```

## üìù Instructions:

1. Create new variables named `square_area1`, `square_area2`, `square_area3` and call the function `calculate_area` three times, one for each square in the picture, for example: 

```python
# For the first figure:
square_area1 = calculate_area(4,4)
```

## üí° Hints:

+ Call the `calculate_area` function three times, one per each square, passing the length and edge of each square.
