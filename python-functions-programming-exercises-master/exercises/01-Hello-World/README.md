# `01` Hello World

In Python, we use **print** to make the computer write anything we want (the content of a variable, a given string, etc.) in something called "the console".

Every language has **functions** to integrate with the console, as it was the only way to interact with the users at the beginning (before Windows, Linux or macOS arrived).

Today, printing in the console is mostly used as a monitoring and debugging tool, ideal for leaving a trace of the content of variables during the program's execution.

This is an example of how to use it:

```py
print("How are you?")
```

## üìù Instructions:

1. Use `print()` to display `"Hello World"` on the console. Feel free to try other things as well.
