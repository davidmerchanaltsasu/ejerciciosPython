*Estas instrucciones [están disponibles en 🇪🇸 español](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/python-functions-programming-exercises/blob/master/README.es.md) :es:*

Learn and practice Python Functions. You will see the following concepts:

1. Declaring a function.

2. Calling a function.

3. Function scopes. 

4. Nest functions.

5. Recursive functions and many other functional concepts. 

> Note: The entire tutorial is 👆 interactive, ✅ auto-graded and with 📹 video tutorials.

These exercises were built in collaboration, we need you! If you find any bugs or misspellings, please contribute and report them.

## One click installation (recommended):

You can open these exercises in just a few seconds by clicking: [Open in Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/?repo=4GeeksAcademy/python-functions-programming-exercises) (recommended) or [Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/python-functions-programming-exercises).

> Once you have VSCode open, the LearnPack exercises should start automatically. If exercises don't run automatically you can try typing on your terminal: `$ learnpack start`

## Local Installation

1. Make sure you have [LearnPack](https://learnpack.co) installed, node.js version 14+, and Python version 3+. This is the command to install LearnPack:

```bash
$ npm i -g @learnpack/learnpack@2.1.20 && learnpack plugins:install @learnpack/python@1.0.0
```

2. Clone or download this repository in your local environment.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/python-functions-programming-exercises.git
$ cd python-functions-programming-exercises
```

> Note: Once you finish downloading, you will find an "exercises" folder that contains all the exercises within.

3. Start the tutorial/exercises by running the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
$ pip3 install pytest==6.2.5 pytest-testdox mock
$ learnpack start
```

## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small Python application containing the following files:

1. **app.py:** represents the entry Python file that will be executed by the computer.
2. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
3. **test.py:** you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.

> Note: The exercises have automatic grading, but it's very rigid and strict, my recommendation is to not take the tests too serious and use them only as a suggestion, or you may get frustrated.
