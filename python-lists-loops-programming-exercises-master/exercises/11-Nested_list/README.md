# `11` Nested list

It is possible to find a list comprised of other lists (it is called a two-dimensional list or matrix).

In this example, we have a list of coordinates that you can access by doing the following:

```py
# The first coordinate is latitude
latitude = coordinates_list[0][0]
# The second coordinate is longitude
longitude = coordinates_list[0][1]
```

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Loop through the list, printing only the *longitudes*.

## 💡 Hint:

+ Remember, the index of the first item in a list is `list[0]`.

## 💻 Expected result:

```py
-112.633853
-63.987
-81.901693
-71.653268
```
