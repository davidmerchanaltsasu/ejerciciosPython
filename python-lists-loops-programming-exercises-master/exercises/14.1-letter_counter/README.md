# `14.1` Letter counter

## 📝 Instructions:

Our customer needs a program that counts the letter repetitions in a given string, for example:

The string `"Hello World"` contains the following repetitions `h=1 e=1 l=3 o=2 w=1 r=1 d=1`.

1. Count the letters of the string in the variable `par` and print the number of times a letter is repeated throughout the string.

2. Capitalization should not affect the count (i.e. if there is a string that contains a capital `A` as well as a lowercase `a` the count for "a" should be 2).

3. Spaces should be ignored!

## 💻 Expected result:

```py
print(count("Hello World"))
# This will print: {'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 3, 'o': 2, 'w': 1, 'r': 1, 'd': 1}
```
