# `10.1` And one and two and three

Dictionaries (or "dict" in Python) are a way of storing elements just like you would in a Python list, but instead of accessing elements using its index, you assign a fixed key to it and access the element using the key. What you now deal with is a `key-value` pair, which is sometimes a more appropriate data structure for solving different problems than a simple list.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Given a contact dictionary, please loop through all its keys and values and print them on the console.

2. You will have to loop over its keys to be able to print them.

## 💡 Hints:

- contact.keys()  `['fullname', 'phone', 'email']`

- contact.values()  `['Jane Doe', '321-321-4321', 'test@test.com']`

- contact.items()  `[('fullname', 'Jane Doe'), ('phone', '321-321-4321'), ('email', 'test@test.com')]`

## 💻 Example console output:

```py
fullname: John Doe
phone: 123-123-2134
email: test@nowhere.com
```
