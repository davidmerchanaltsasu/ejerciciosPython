You are working with a DJ, and he needs a program that can create beats for his songs.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Create a function called `lyrics_generator` that receives a list. The list passed to the function will be something like this:

```py
[0,0,1,1,0,0,0]
```

2. For each Zero you will add to the string `Boom`.

3. For each One you will add to the string `Drop the bass`.

4. **In Addition**, if you find the number `1` three times in a row, you should ALSO ADD to the string `!!!Break the bass!!!`

## 💡 Hints:

- Remember to use auxiliary variables.

- Declare a variable to store your strings.
