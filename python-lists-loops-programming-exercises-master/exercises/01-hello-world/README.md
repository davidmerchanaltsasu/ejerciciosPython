# `01` Hello World

In Python, we use `print` to make the computer write anything we want (the content of a variable, a given string, etc.) in something called "the console".

Every language has a console, as it was the only way to interact with the users at the beginning (before Windows, Linux or macOS arrived).

Today, printing in the console is mostly used as a monitoring and debugging tool, ideal for leaving a trace of the content of variables during the program's execution.

This is an example of how to use it:

```py
print("How are you?")
```

## üìù Instructions:

1. Use the `print()` function to print `Hello World` on the console. 

## üí° Hint:

+ Feel free to try other things as well.
