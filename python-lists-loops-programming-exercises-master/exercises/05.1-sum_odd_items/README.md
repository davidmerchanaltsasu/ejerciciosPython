# `05.1` Sum the odd numbers

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Create a function called `sum_odds` that sums all the odd numbers in the `my_list` variable.

2. Return and print the result.

## 💡 Hints:

- You will need to declare an **auxiliary variable** outside the loop to keep adding the values.

- You have to loop the list.

- On each loop, you have to ask if the value of the list in that index position is an odd number.

- If its odd, then add the value to the **auxiliary variable**.

- An **auxiliary variable** is a regular variable, the only difference is a logical difference; an **auxiliary variable** is like a chosen one, it'll be useful until it completes its purpose (add all the values, make a copy of a value, etc.).
