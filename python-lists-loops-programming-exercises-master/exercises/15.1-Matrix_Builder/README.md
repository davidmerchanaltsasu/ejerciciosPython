# `15.1` Matrix Builder

After some malicious code, mainly by Mr. Smith, the Matrix has some gaping holes, and it needs some help to rebuild. Create a matrix of 1's based on a parameter.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Create a function called `matrix_builder`, which will expect 1 parameter (an integer):

+ This number represents the amount of rows and columns for the matrix.

+ Example: 5 means that the matrix should be 5x5.

2. This function should return a list of lists that represent the matrix.

## 💻 Expected result:

With 3 as an argument it should return:

```py
[
  [1, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 1]
]
```

## 💡 Hint:

+ Remember to append only the number `1`.
