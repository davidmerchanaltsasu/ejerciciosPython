# `09` Max integer from my_list

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Create a function named `max_integer`

2. This function should take a list as an input parameter and return the maximum number found in the list. 

3. You should use a `for` loop to iterate through the list. 

4. Use the `print()` function to print what the function returns when it is called.
  
    + For example: `print(my_function(param))` 

## 💡 Hints:

- Define an auxiliary variable and set the first value to the first element on the list.

- Then compare the variable with all the items in the list.

- Replace the value every time the new element is bigger than the one stored in the auxiliary variable.

- At the end, you will have the biggest number stored in the variable.

## 💻 Expected result:

```py
5435
```
